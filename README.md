# CausalInferenceNBA-

This project is designed to automate and streamline single-player, multi-player, team and rival-player queries processing for causal inference calculations.
The repo if focused on preprocessing, test cases, and utility functions. Below is an overview of the folder and file structure:

Project Structure:

Datasets/

Contains raw and processed datasets required for query automation.
Example for raw: team.csv, player_stats.csv
Example for processed: team_game_stats.csv, player_game_stats.csv

Preprocessing/

Includes scripts and notebooks for preprocessing the datasets.
Automates cleaning, augmenting, and preparing the data for further analysis.

TestCases/

Contains test case scripts or data for validating query from different NBA questions (player's contrebution, team success, etc.).
Ensures functionality and accuracy of implemented solutions.

utils/

Houses utility functions and helper scripts to support main processes.
mainly automating the process and recurring function for calculating the causal inference

NBA_PROJECT_Full_NoteBook.ipynb
